## Features Implemented

### 1. Report Generation
- Generate comprehensive statistical reports with multiple filtering options
- Support for filtering by hospital, department/specialty, and date range
- Default date range of last 30 days when not specified
- Handles "No Data" scenarios gracefully with appropriate messaging

### 2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Total Visits:** Total number of appointments in the date range
- **Confirmed Appointments:** Number of successfully confirmed appointments
- **Pending Payments:** Appointments awaiting payment confirmation
- **Cancelled Appointments:** Number of cancelled appointments
- **Total Revenue:** Sum of all completed payments
- **Average Wait Time:** Average time (in hours) between booking and appointment
- **Appointment Completion Rate:** Percentage of confirmed appointments

### 3. Analytics & Breakdowns

#### Daily Visits
- Time-series data showing visits per day
- Breakdown by confirmed and cancelled appointments
- Sorted chronologically for trend analysis

#### Department Breakdown
- Statistics grouped by medical specialty/department
- Total and confirmed appointments per department
- Revenue generated per department
- Completion rate per department
- Sorted by total appointments (descending)

### 4. Export Functionality
- **PDF Export:** Professionally formatted PDF reports with tables and KPIs
- **CSV Export:** Machine-readable CSV format for further analysis
- Automatic file naming with timestamps
- Audit trail of all exports with status tracking

### 5. Filtering Capabilities
- **Hospital Filter:** Filter reports by specific hospital name
- **Department Filter:** Filter by medical specialty (e.g., Cardiology, Dermatology)
- **Date Range Filter:** Specify custom start and end dates

## Design Principles & Best Practices

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility:** Each class has a focused, single purpose
- **Open/Closed:** Service extensible for new report types without modification
- **Liskov Substitution:** Proper inheritance hierarchy maintained
- **Interface Segregation:** Repository interfaces focused on specific data needs
- **Dependency Inversion:** Dependencies injected through constructor

### Code Quality
- Lombok annotations for reducing boilerplate code
- Comprehensive error handling with appropriate exceptions
- Transaction management for data consistency
- Efficient query design to minimize database calls
- Proper use of Java 8+ features (streams, optionals)

### API Design
- RESTful principles followed
- Appropriate HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for exports)
- Proper status codes (200, 400, etc.)
- Content-Type headers for different export formats
- Content-Disposition for file downloads

## Key Features Highlights

### 1. Flexible Filtering
- Supports multiple filter combinations
- Graceful handling of missing or invalid filters

- Read-only transactions for report generation
- Lazy loading where appropriate
- Pagination considerations for large datasets

### 5. Edge Case Handling
- "No Data" messaging when filters return empty results
- Default date range when dates not specified
- Error handling for export failures
- Validation of filter parameters
